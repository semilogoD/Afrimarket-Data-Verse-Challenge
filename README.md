# Afrimarket-Data-Verse-Challenge

## üöÄ Project Overview
AfriMarket, a leading Jumia-style e-commerce platform operating across Nigeria and Ghana, faced declining customer satisfaction despite record-breaking traffic. 

As a Data Intelligence Officer, I conducted comprehensive marketplace data analysis to identify fraudulent patterns, assess seller reliability, and develop actionable trust-building strategies.

## üéØ Key Objectives
‚Ä¢	Fraud Detection: Identify suspicious seller activities and fake review patterns

‚Ä¢	Risk Assessment: Analyze delivery delays, complaint patterns, and return rates

‚Ä¢	Trust Framework: Develop data-driven seller accountability measures

‚Ä¢	Business Intelligence: Create actionable insights to improve customer retention

## üìä Dataset & Methodology
### Data Sources
‚Ä¢	Seller performance metrics

‚Ä¢	Customer transaction records

‚Ä¢	Delivery and logistics data

‚Ä¢	Customer reviews and ratings

‚Ä¢	Return and complaint records

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel -	Data exploration & visualization	Pivot tables, conditional formatting, statistical functions

Power Query	- Data transformation	ETL processes, data cleaning, automated workflows

Power Pivot	- Data modeling	Relationships, DAX measures, large dataset management

Excel Charts - Dashboard creation	Stacked charts, trend analysis, KPI dashboards

## üîç Key Findings

## ü§ñ Predictive Model Development

### Risk Scoring Algorithm:

Risk Score = (Delay Flag √ó 0.4) + (Complaint Flag √ó 0.4) + (Price Flag √ó 0.2)

Feature Engineering

- Delay Flag: 1 if delivery > 5 days, 0 otherwise

- Price Flag: 1 if price > ‚Ç¶256 (average), 0 otherwise

- Complaint Flag: Binary indicator for complaint presence

- IF(Risk Score > 0.6, "Likely Return", "No Return")

## üìã Strategic Recommendations
### üö® Immediate Actions

1.	Seller Sanctions: Suspend high-risk sellers (IDs: 25, 19, 36, 33, 39)
  
2.	Category Regulation: Implement stricter controls for Home & Living and Groceries
   
3.	Regional Focus: Address logistics bottlenecks in the Southwest and Volta Regions
